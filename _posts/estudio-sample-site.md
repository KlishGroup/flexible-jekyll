# Sample Responsive Sites for TeamSite’s Experience Studio

## Experience TeamSite’s New Interface, Experience Studio

[OpenText’s
TeamSite](https://www.opentext.com/products-and-solutions/products/customer-experience-management/web-content-management/opentext-teamsite)
comes out of the box with Experience Studio, the easy-to-use authoring
interface which speeds up the create-to-publish cycle with tools to
easily import HTML designs, WYSIWYG editing, drag and drop forms and
components, edit, preview and publish single page applications (SPAs)
and integrated content search capabilities allowing organizations to
“create once, publish anywhere.”

[See a sample of the interface in
use!](https://v2e9r2n5.map2.ssl.hwcdn.net/vidad/sunnyside.vidavee.com/opentext/OTUnrestricted/A7C49BEA1DCF55A2C357339A6E13E754.mp4)

## Seeing Is Believing

In order to showcase the example uses of this interface, Klish Group has
developed sample sites based on the Foundation (5 and 6) and Bootstrap
(3 and 4) frameworks. These sites contain all the pieces required for a
modernized content authoring experience. Each site includes:

-   Templates
-   Pages
-   Content Templates (to be used with individual components)
-   Components (boxes of content that make up a page)

## Getting Hands On

The SPAR (Site Publisher ARchive) file can be downloaded from this
[page](https://knowledge.opentext.com/knowledge/llisapi.dll/open/69460803)
in OpenText knowledge base. The project is named “TeamSite Add-Ons from
Partners”, from there the SPAR can be downloaded. Follow the
instructions in the README.txt file for installation details.

Additional details can be found in the authoring guide.

Pages can be created utilizing the following components, which have all
been developed in XSL 2.0:

-   Header - Sticky Header component on the page which uses the External
    class:com.interwoven.livesite.external.impl.LivesiteSiteMap to read
    the default.sitemap to display navigation links in top nav. It uses 
	the "Navigation/HeaderDCR to load labels or images in the header.

-   Hero - Single image component with Title, Body and CTA button. The
    text content can be aligned - Left, Center and Right

-   Breadcrumb - This component shows the breadcrumbs of the page the
    user is on. It reads the links from default.sitemap using the
    Component External.

-   Simple Content - Simple component to display Title, Date, Body and
    CTA.

-   Video - This component displays the responsive Youtube or Vimeo
    video using the Video ID.

-   Footer - Sticky Footer component on the page uses DCR to display the
    links in the footer.

-   Carousel - This component uses DCR to display images with Title,
    Body and CTA Button.

-   Card - This component uses DCR to display cards horizontally in a
    row of 2-4 tiles with Image, Title, Sub Title, Body and CTA from a
    DCR.

-   Social Sharing - This component uses DCR to fetch the social share
    sites to be included for sharing content. Also, it allows
    "ShareThis" to be setup. Users will need to provide the "ShareThis"
	Property ID in the component datum to enable "ShareThis" widget on 
	the page.

-   Disqus - This component uses the disqus plug-in. The users need to
    register on disqus site and get the forum name. This short forum
    name needs to be set in the component datum to view Disqus on the site.

-   Adaptive Image Hero - This component loads a different sized image
    based on the media size. It uses the OpenText Adaptive Media Images
    which can be transformed on the fly.
